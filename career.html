          <p>If you are looking for a fun and challenging place to
          explore the horizons of knowledge and to exhibit your
          creativity, you have reached the right place. We are
          working on the cutting edge open source technology with
          both enterprise as well as clients in the new media.</p>

          <p>We at Artha42 believe that software development is
          more of a craft than an engineering practice that can be
          transcribed as a set of processes. Building software is
          an individual and intrinsic process. A naive person would
          assume that a programmer only works when he is in front
          of a desk while programming. But nothing could be farther
          from the truth. A programmer once presented with a
          problem thinks about it. It first needs to settle in.
          This process is called percolation. The brain needs such
          breaks for it to look at the problem from a fresh
          perspective. Then there are those a-ha moments. Where the
          solution to a problem becomes so obvious that you often
          wonder why you did not think of it earlier. This is such
          an intrinsic process for the individual that no amount of
          knowledge transfer can replace it.</p>

          <p>Good programmers can only evolve from experience. But
          this process can be greatly accelerated via mentoring and
          coaching. These are aspects of a craft rather than a
          business process. Since we at Artha42 are keenly aware of
          this aspect of software development, we are providing an
          unique opportunity to students to participate in our
          internship program.</p>

          <p>We are also looking for experienced professionals to
          take on the role of mentors.</p>

          <p>Artha42 is also strongly committed to open source. As
          Sir Isaac Newton once aptly said, "I stand on the
          shoulder of the giants". The truly altruistic work of
          numerous people in the community have enabled us explore
          and expand the frontiers of technology.</p>
          <p>Come and join us to make software with a difference.
